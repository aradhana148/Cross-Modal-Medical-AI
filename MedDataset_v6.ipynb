      "\n",
      "2.  **Identify Key Learning Objectives for Junior Nurses in their first month related to Ergonomics/Body Mechanics:**  For a junior nurse, initial training on ergonomics and body mechanics would likely focus on:\n",
      "    *   **Importance of good posture and body mechanics:** Understanding *why* it's crucial for their health and patient safety.\n",
      "    *   **Identifying common postural mistakes in nursing tasks:** Recognizing *what* are the risky postures and movements during routine nursing activities.\n",
      "    *   **Learning correct techniques for common nursing tasks:** Knowing *how* to perform tasks safely and ergonomically.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Brainstorm potential video content themes relevant to Nursing Ergonomics/Body Mechanics:**  Imagine a video that would be useful for training junior nurses on this topic. It might cover:\n",
      "    *   Introduction to ergonomics in nursing and its importance.\n",
      "    *   Demonstration of correct lifting techniques for patients and equipment.\n",
      "    *   Proper posture while charting, administering medication, and performing bedside care.\n",

      "**Phase 2: Question and Answer Pair Generation (Targeting \"Why,\" \"What,\" and \"How\")**\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Generate a \"Why\" type Question:**  Focus on the rationale and importance of good ergonomics and body mechanics in nursing.\n",
      "    *   **Question Idea:**  Why is it important for nurses to learn and practice proper body mechanics and ergonomics from the beginning of their career?\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Generate a \"What\" type Question:** Focus on identifying key concepts, common issues, or elements related to ergonomics in nursing.\n",
      "    *   **Question Idea:** What are some common nursing tasks where poor body mechanics can lead to injuries, and what are the signs a junior nurse should watch out for in their posture?\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Generate a \"How\" type Question:** Focus on practical application, techniques, or procedures related to ergonomic practices in nursing.\n",
      "    *   **Question Idea:** How should a junior nurse position their body when assisting a patient to move in bed to ensure both patient safety and their own ergonomic well-being?\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Question:** Why is it important for nurses to learn and practice proper body mechanics and ergonomics from the beginning of their career?\n",
      "*   **Answer:** It is crucial for nurses to prioritize body mechanics and ergonomics from the start to prevent musculoskeletal injuries like back pain, which are very common in nursing.  Practicing good techniques early on helps build healthy habits that can extend their career longevity and reduce fatigue.  Furthermore, proper body mechanics also ensures patient safety during transfers and movements, minimizing the risk of injury to patients as well. Finally, efficient body mechanics can actually make nursing tasks easier and less physically demanding over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Question and Answer Pair 2 (What):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Question:** What are some common nursing tasks where poor body mechanics can lead to injuries, and what are the signs a junior nurse should watch out for in their posture during these tasks?\n",
      "*   **Answer:** Several common nursing tasks can put nurses at risk if poor body mechanics are used. These include: lifting and transferring patients, repositioning patients in bed, prolonged standing or bending while providing bedside care, and even repetitive tasks like charting on a computer or administering medications.  Signs of poor posture to watch for include: bending at the waist instead of knees when lifting, twisting the torso while carrying objects, hunching over while charting, and feeling strain or discomfort in the back, neck, or shoulders after performing these tasks.  Being mindful of these tasks and posture cues is essential for injury prevention.\n",

      "    \"multimodal_answer\": \"Maintaining good posture is critical for nurses to prevent injuries and ensure longevity in their physically demanding profession.  As illustrated in Frame [00:06:45], adopting an upright posture with shoulders relaxed and core engaged, rather than slouching, reduces strain on the spine and back muscles. This upright posture is essential not just when using phones, but also during patient care activities like patient handling and prolonged standing.\",\n",

      "**Phase 1: Video Content Analysis and Topic Identification (One-time process)**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Video Access and Initial Viewing:**  Assume access to the video content.  Watch the video from beginning to end to get a general understanding of the topics covered.  For the purpose of this example, let's imagine the video is about \"Introduction to Patient Safety in Hospitals\" (since the example question about phone posture might relate to workplace safety, but we'll shift to more core nursing topics).\n",
      "2.  **Detailed Video Review and Note-Taking:** Watch the video again, this time more carefully, taking notes on key concepts, procedures, and information presented that would be relevant for a junior nurse's training in their first month. Focus on identifying potential quiz topics.  For \"Introduction to Patient Safety in Hospitals,\" these might include:\n",
      "    * Hand hygiene protocols\n",
      "    * Patient identification procedures\n",
      "    * Medication safety guidelines\n",
      "    * Fall prevention strategies\n",
      "    * Communication protocols for safety\n",

      "**Phase 2: Generate Question and Answer Pair 1**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Select Quiz Topic 1:** Choose a specific topic from the notes taken in Phase 1. Let's select \"Hand Hygiene Protocols\" as the first topic.\n",
      "2.  **Formulate Question 1:**  Develop a question related to the chosen topic that is suitable for a junior nurse.  Example Question: \"According to hospital safety guidelines, when is it mandatory for healthcare staff to perform hand hygiene?\"\n",
      "3.  **Locate Answer Segment in Video:** Review the video again, specifically looking for the section that discusses when hand hygiene should be performed. Identify the starting and ending points of this segment. Let's assume this segment is from 01:30 to 02:05 in the video.\n",
      "4.  **Determine Timestamps for Answer 1:**\n",
      "    * Convert the start time to seconds: 1 minute * 60 seconds/minute + 30 seconds = 90 seconds.\n",
      "    * Convert the end time to seconds: 2 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 5 seconds = 125 seconds.\n",
      "    * Let's assume the video length is 600 seconds (10 minutes) and the video ID and URL are hypothetical for this example (since no specific video was provided for this task).\n",
      "5.  **Format Question and Answer Pair 1:** Construct the JSON-like structure for the first Q&A pair.\n",

      "1.  **Select Quiz Topic 2:** Choose a *different* topic from Phase 1 notes. Let's select \"Patient Identification Procedures\".\n",
      "2.  **Formulate Question 2:** Develop a question related to patient identification. Example Question: \"What are the two primary patient identifiers that should be verified before administering medication to a patient?\"\n",
      "3.  **Locate Answer Segment in Video:** Find the video segment discussing patient identification and medication administration. Let's assume this segment is from 03:40 to 04:15.\n",
      "4.  **Determine Timestamps for Answer 2:**\n",
      "    * Convert start time to seconds: 3 minutes * 60 + 40 seconds = 220 seconds.\n",
      "    * Convert end time to seconds: 4 minutes * 60 + 15 seconds = 255 seconds.\n",
      "5.  **Format Question and Answer Pair 2:** Construct the JSON-like structure for the second Q&A pair.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 4: Generate Question and Answer Pair 3**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Select Quiz Topic 3:** Choose another *different* topic. Let's select \"Fall Prevention Strategies\".\n",
      "2.  **Formulate Question 3:** Develop a question about fall prevention. Example Question: \"Name three key strategies that nurses should implement to prevent patient falls in a hospital setting.\"\n",
      "3.  **Locate Answer Segment in Video:** Find the video segment discussing fall prevention strategies. Let's assume this segment is from 07:10 to 08:00.\n",

      "    * Convert start time to seconds: 7 minutes * 60 + 10 seconds = 430 seconds.\n",

      "1.  **Understand the Goal:** The request is to create a Question and Answer pair in Tamil for training junior nurses. This pair should be derived from the video information provided in the JSON. The question should be suitable for an e-learning module and test basic nursing knowledge applicable during their first month.\n",
      "2.  **Analyze the Sample Data:**\n",
      "    *   `sample_id: 2702` - Unique identifier, not directly relevant to content generation.\n",
      "    *   `question: \"How to hold your phone to avoid poor posture?\"` -  This is the sample question in English, giving a clue about the video's general theme (posture, ergonomics).\n",
      "    *   `answer_start: \"06:37\", answer_end: \"06:59\", answer_start_second: 397, answer_end_second: 419` - These indicate the time segment in the video where the answer to the sample question can be found.\n",

      "3.  **Infer Video Content for Nursing Context:** Although the sample question is about phone posture, for a *nursing* context, we need to relate posture or ergonomics to nursing tasks. Common areas for junior nurses in their first month include basic patient care, hygiene, safety, and communication.  Posture and body mechanics are crucial in patient handling to prevent nurse injuries.\n",
      "4.  **Brainstorm Nursing Questions Related to Posture/Ergonomics:**\n",
      "    *   How should a nurse position herself when assisting a patient to sit up in bed to avoid back strain?\n",
      "    *   What is the correct posture for a nurse while performing bed bath to avoid discomfort?\n",
      "    *   How to maintain good posture while standing for long periods during ward rounds?\n",
      "    *   What is the best way for a nurse to lift or move objects in a patient's room while protecting her back?\n",
      "    *   How should a nurse bend down to pick up something from the floor to avoid injury?\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Select a Relevant Question for Junior Nurses (in English):**  \"What is the correct way for a nurse to bend down to pick up something from the floor to avoid injury?\" This is a practical and basic scenario relevant to junior nurses.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Formulate the Answer (in English):** \"Bend your knees and keep your back straight while bending down to pick up objects.\"  This is a simple, actionable answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Translate Question and Answer to Tamil:**\n",
      "    *   **Question (English):** \"What is the correct way for a nurse to bend down to pick up something from the floor to avoid injury?\"\n",
      "    *   **Question (Tamil):** \"கீழே இருந்து ஏதாவது ஒன்றை எடுக்கும்போது காயம் ஏற்படாமல் இருக்க ஒரு நர்ஸ் குனிந்து எடுக்க சரியான வழி என்ன?\" (Keezhay irunthu ethāvathu onrai edukkumbōthu kāyam ēṟpadāmal irukka oru nars kuninthu edukka sariyāna vazhi enna?)\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Answer (English):** \"Bend your knees and keep your back straight while bending down to pick up objects.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "8.  **Final Check for Relevance and Language:** The Tamil question and answer are grammatically correct and relevant to basic nursing practice. They are suitable for a junior nurse's training in Tamil.\n",

      "Alright, alright, settle down folks, settle down!  Hey everybody, Joe here, you’re looking at me, and I’m looking at you, and frankly, I’m a little disappointed in your outfit choices tonight.  Just kidding!  You all look… adequately clothed.  No, seriously, thanks for coming out, you could be anywhere, but you chose to be here, listening to my…  *gestures vaguely* …thoughts.  So let’s get this show on the road, shall we?\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I was at the grocery store the other day, right?  And I’m in the produce section, trying to figure out what a parsnip even *is* – seriously, is it a white carrot?  Is it a root vegetable cry for help?  I don’t know!  Anyway, this lady, she bumps right into me with her cart.  Didn’t even say “excuse me,” just kept rummaging through the avocados like she was defusing a bomb.  And I’m thinking, “Lady, personal space!  It’s a thing!”  But I’m too polite to say anything, you know?  Midwestern upbringing, it’s a curse and a blessing.  So I just mumbled something about “avocado anxiety” under my breath.  And she whips around, eyes blazing, and says, **\"Well, they *are* always going bad!\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, \"Well, they *are* always going bad!\"  That's her response to me, mumbling about personal space, because *avocados*.  Like, suddenly we're in some existential crisis about the fleeting nature of guacamole!  I swear, people are weird.  But you know what's even weirder than the avocado lady?  Trying to explain to your kids why you can't just buy *every* toy they see in the store.  It's like negotiating with tiny, adorable terrorists.  \"But Daaaad, I *need* the talking unicorn that farts glitter!\"  No, you don't *need* the talking unicorn that farts glitter, Timmy.  Nobody *needs* that.  Except maybe Timmy, apparently.  And the toy companies, they’re geniuses!  They know exactly how to prey on parental guilt and the insatiable desire of a five-year-old.  It's a conspiracy, I tell you!  A glitter-farting, unicorn-based conspiracy!  And you know what the worst part is?  You cave.  You always cave.  Because the meltdown in aisle six is just not worth it.  So you end up shelling out twenty bucks for a plastic horse that’s going to end up in the bottom of the toy box in a week, forgotten and glitterless.  And you’re just standing there, holding this ridiculous unicorn, thinking, **\"Well, at least it’s not a parsnip.\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, at least it’s not a parsnip.\"  See?  I brought it back around!  Comedy gold, folks!  No, but seriously, parsnips.  What *are* they?  I Googled it.  Apparently, they’re related to carrots, which just makes the whole thing even more confusing.  Like, why make a white carrot?  What’s the point?  Is it for people who are tired of orange?  Is it some kind of culinary rebellion?  \"Down with orange!  Up with… beige-ish white!\"  I don’t get it.  And the recipes!  They’re always like, “Roasted parsnips with a hint of thyme and a balsamic glaze.”  Who has time for that?  I can barely manage to boil water without setting off the smoke alarm.  My cooking skills are less “culinary artist” and more “survivor in the wilderness.”  My wife, she’s the chef in our house.  Thank god.  Otherwise, we’d be living on cereal and takeout.  And maybe roasted parsnips, if I ever figure out what to do with them.  But for now, they remain a mystery, lurking in the produce aisle, whispering, **\"Boil me, roast me, glaze me… I dare you.\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Boil me, roast me, glaze me… I dare you.\"  Okay, parsnips are getting a little too aggressive for my taste.  Let’s talk about something less… root vegetable-y.  Let’s talk about technology.  Specifically, smartphones.  These things, they’re amazing, right?  You can order food, watch movies, stalk your ex on social media – all from the palm of your hand!  It’s incredible!  But also… terrifying.  Because we’re all walking around, glued to these little screens, completely oblivious to the world around us.  I saw a guy walking down the street the other day, texting furiously, and he walked straight into a lamppost.  *Thump!*  Just bounced right off it like a cartoon character.  He didn’t even look up from his phone!  Just kept texting!  I wanted to yell, \"Hey!  Lamppost attack!  You've been targeted!\"  But I was too busy checking my own phone for notifications.  Hypocritical, I know.  We’re all hypocrites in the digital age.  We complain about screen time, but then we spend hours scrolling through endless feeds of cat videos and political arguments.  It’s a vicious cycle.  And the worst part is, we know it’s bad for us, but we can’t stop.  It’s like a digital addiction.  We’re all junkies, jonesing for our next hit of social media dopamine.  And the tech companies, they’re the pushers.  They know exactly how to keep us hooked.  Notifications, infinite scroll, personalized algorithms… it’s all designed to keep us coming back for more.  And we do.  We always do.  We’re like lab rats, pressing the button for that sweet, sweet digital reward.  And the lampposts are just waiting for us, patiently, silently, thinking, **\"Maybe they’ll finally look up this time.\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe they’ll finally look up this time.\"  Optimistic lampposts.  I like that.  But let’s be real, we’re not looking up.  We’re looking down.  Always down.  At our phones.  Checking emails, scrolling through Instagram, playing Candy Crush…  Candy Crush!  Remember Candy Crush?  That was a whole thing, wasn’t it?  Everyone was obsessed with it.  Little candies exploding, satisfying sounds, the relentless pursuit of level 5000-whatever.  I played it for a while.  Got pretty into it, actually.  Almost lost my job because of it.  Just kidding… mostly.  But seriously, these games, they’re designed to be addictive.  They’re like digital crack cocaine.  Except instead of ruining your life and losing all your teeth, you just waste hours of your time and strain your thumbs.  Is that progress?  I don’t know.  But I do know that I deleted Candy Crush eventually.  Cold turkey.  Went through withdrawal.  Had the shakes.  Started seeing candy in my sleep.  But I kicked the habit.  I’m clean now.  Well, mostly clean.  I might have downloaded it again last week… just to see if I could still beat my high score.  Relapse is a part of recovery, right?  That’s what they say in the support groups.  Or at least, that’s what I imagine they say.  I haven’t actually been to a Candy Crush Anonymous meeting.  Yet.  But if I do, I’m gonna start the meeting by saying, **\"Hi, my name is Joe, and I’m addicted to exploding virtual candies.\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hi, my name is Joe, and I’m addicted to exploding virtual candies.\"  Sounds like the start of a very specific support group.  Maybe we should start one.  \"Exploding Candy Addicts Anonymous.\"  ECAA.  We could have meetings in church basements, serve lukewarm coffee and stale cookies, and share our stories of digital candy-related shame.  \"I relapsed last night.  Level 783 got me.  The striped candies… they were just too tempting.\"  \"It’s okay, Joe.  We’ve all been there.  Take it one level at a time.\"  Yeah, I can see it now.  We could even have sponsors.  \"Hey, I’m your sponsor, Brenda.  I’ve been Candy Crush clean for six months.  If you’re feeling the urge, call me.  We can talk about it.  Or we can just… play a different game.  Like Tetris.  Tetris is less addictive, right?\"  No, Brenda, Tetris is not less addictive!  Don’t even get me started on Tetris!  That’s a whole other addiction waiting to happen!  Falling blocks, perfect fits, the constant pressure to clear lines… it’s a nightmare!  A beautiful, blocky, line-clearing nightmare!  Okay, maybe I have a problem.  Maybe I need to join ECAA.  Or maybe I just need to throw my phone in the ocean and live in a cabin in the woods.  Just me, nature, and… probably a really strong Wi-Fi signal.  Because let’s be honest, even in the woods, I’d still be tempted to check my email.  It’s a sickness, I tell you!  A digital, candy-coated, block-falling sickness!  And the only cure… is more cowbell.  No, wait, that’s something else.  The only cure… is probably therapy.  Yeah, definitely therapy.  Or maybe just a really long nap.  Or maybe just admitting to myself, and to all of you, that I have a problem.  A problem with virtual candies and falling blocks.  And maybe, just maybe, that’s the first step.  The first step on the road to recovery.  The first step towards… **\"Exploding Candy Anonymous.\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exploding Candy Anonymous.\"  See?  It’s catchy!  We could get t-shirts!  \"ECAA: One Level at a Time.\"  Or \"ECAA:  We’re crushing our addiction, one candy at a time.\"  Okay, maybe those are a little too on the nose.  But you get the idea!  We could be a movement!  A support group for the digitally addicted masses!  We could hold rallies!  \"Down with Candy Crush!  Up with…  uh…  books?\"  Yeah, books!  Remember books?  Those things made of paper, with words on them?  They’re like…  analog phones.  Except instead of calling people, you… read them.  It’s a whole different experience.  And you know what?  They’re actually kind of nice.  Quiet, peaceful, no notifications, no flashing lights, no exploding candies.  Just words.  Stories.  Ideas.  Imagine that!  Actually focusing on something for more than five seconds!  It’s revolutionary!  I tried reading a book the other day.  It was… challenging.  My attention span is shot.  I kept reaching for my phone, expecting a notification.  But there were no notifications.  Just words.  Lots and lots of words.  It was… overwhelming.  But also… kind of nice.  Like going for a walk in the woods, without Wi-Fi.  Quiet, peaceful, and slightly terrifying because you’re convinced a bear is going to jump out at any moment.  But still… nice.  And maybe, just maybe, if we all put down our phones for a little while and picked up a book, we’d all be a little bit happier.  A little bit calmer.  A little bit less addicted to exploding virtual candies.  And maybe, just maybe, we’d finally realize that the real world is actually pretty interesting too.  Even without notifications.  Even without Candy Crush.  Even without… **\"Exploding virtual candies.\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exploding virtual candies.\"  They’re everywhere!  In our phones, in our dreams, in our nightmares…  Okay, maybe I’m exaggerating a little bit.  But you get my point.  These digital addictions are real.  And they’re messing with our brains.  I read an article the other day about how social media is rewiring our brains to crave instant gratification.  We’re becoming dopamine junkies, chasing likes and retweets and fleeting moments of online validation.  And it’s making us miserable!  We’re comparing ourselves to everyone else’s perfectly curated online personas, feeling inadequate and insecure, and then scrolling for more validation to make ourselves feel better, which just makes us feel worse…  It’s a vicious cycle!  And it’s exhausting!  I’m exhausted just thinking about it!  I need a nap.  Or a digital detox.  Or maybe just a really, really strong cup of coffee.  Yeah, coffee.  That’s the answer.  Caffeine.  The original addiction.  Before smartphones, before social media, before exploding virtual candies, there was coffee.  The fuel of civilization.  The elixir of productivity.  The…  legal drug of choice for comedians everywhere.  I love coffee.  I drink way too much of it.  It’s probably not good for me.  But it makes me feel…  awake.  Alert.  Ready to face the day.  Or at least, ready to face the next five minutes.  Because let’s be honest, the caffeine rush only lasts so long.  Then you crash.  And you need more coffee.  And the cycle continues.  Just like with social media.  Except coffee is delicious.  And social media is…  sometimes entertaining.  But mostly just anxiety-inducing.  So yeah, coffee.  Definitely coffee.  The answer to all of life’s problems.  Or at least, the answer to the problem of… **\"Exhaustion from thinking about exploding virtual candies.\"**\"Exhaustion from thinking about exploding virtual candies.\"  Yeah, that’s a real thing, folks.  It’s in the DSM-6, I think.  Right next to \"Parsnip Anxiety\" and \"Avocado Meltdown Disorder.\"  No, I’m just kidding.  Those aren’t real.  Yet.  But they might be someday, if we keep going the way we’re going.  We’ll all be diagnosed with some kind of bizarre, digitally-induced mental ailment.  \"Doctor, I think I have…  'Notification Fatigue Syndrome.'\"  \"Ah yes, NFS.  A very common condition.  Take two unfollows and call me in the morning.\"  Yeah, that’s our future.  Medical advice dispensed in emojis and hashtags.  \"Feeling blue?  #SadFaceEmoji #TryYoga #BuyMyMerch.\"  It’s going to be great.  Or terrible.  Probably terrible.  But also, kind of funny.  In a dark, dystopian, \"we’re all doomed\" kind of way.  But hey, at least we’ll have memes to distract us from the apocalypse.  Right?  Memes and cat videos.  The two pillars of modern society.  Without them, we’d all just collapse into a heap of existential dread and parsnip-related anxiety.  So thank you, internet.  Thank you for the distractions.  Thank you for the cat videos.  Thank you for the memes.  And thank you for the exploding virtual candies.  Because without them, what would we even complain about?  What would we even joke about?  What would we even… **\"Do with our lives besides stare blankly at parsnips?\"**\n",

      "Abstract: As concurrent programming becomes increasingly prevalent, effectivelyidentifying and addressing concurrency issues such as data races and deadlocksis critical. This study evaluates the performance of several leading largelanguage models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini,and Mistral-AI's Large2, in understanding and analyzing concurrency issueswithin software programs. Given that relaxed memory models, such as Total StoreOrder (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO), are widely implemented and adaptedin modern systems, supported even by commodity architectures like ARM and x86,our evaluation focuses not only on sequentially consistent memory models butalso on these relaxed memory models. Specifically, we assess two main aspects:the models' capacity to detect concurrency problems under a sequentiallyconsistent memory model and their ability to verify the correctness conditionsof concurrent programs across both sequentially consistent and relaxed memorymodels. To do this, we leverage SV-COMP's pthread tests and 25 ARM Litmus testsdesigned to evaluate Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO)memory models. The experimental results reveal that GPT-4, GPT-4o, andMistral-AI's Large2 demonstrate a robust understanding of concurrency issues,effectively identifying data races and deadlocks when assessed under asequentially consistent memory model. However, despite its superiorperformance, all selected LLMs face significant challenges verifying programcorrectness under relaxed memory models. These LLMs exhibit limitations inaccurately capturing memory ordering constraints, and their currentcapabilities fall short in verifying even small programs in these complexscenarios.\n",

      "Abstract: Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is a thriving research area withimpressive outcomes being achieved on high-resource languages. However, theapplication of cross-lingual transfer to the ASTE task has been relativelyunexplored, and current code-switching methods still suffer from term boundarydetection issues and out-of-dictionary problems. In this study, we introduce anovel Test-Time Code-SWitching (TT-CSW) framework, which bridges the gapbetween the bilingual training phase and the monolingual test-time prediction.During training, a generative model is developed based on bilingualcode-switched training data and can produce bilingual ASTE triplets forbilingual inputs. In the testing stage, we employ an alignment-basedcode-switching technique for test-time augmentation. Extensive experiments oncross-lingual ASTE datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.We achieve an average improvement of 3.7% in terms of weighted-averaged F1 infour datasets with different languages. Additionally, we set a benchmark usingChatGPT and GPT-4, and demonstrate that even smaller generative modelsfine-tuned with our proposed TT-CSW framework surpass ChatGPT and GPT-4 by14.2% and 5.0% respectively.\n",

      "Abstract: Biological relation networks contain rich information for understanding thebiological mechanisms behind the relationship of entities such as genes,proteins, diseases, and chemicals. The vast growth of biomedical literatureposes significant challenges updating the network knowledge. The recentBiomedical Relation Extraction Dataset (BioRED) provides valuable manualannotations, facilitating the develop-ment of machine-learning and pre-trainedlanguage model approaches for automatically identifying novel document-level(inter-sentence context) relationships. Nonetheless, its annotations lackdirectionality (subject/object) for the entity roles, essential for studyingcomplex biological networks. Herein we annotate the entity roles of therelationships in the BioRED corpus and subsequently propose a novel multi-tasklanguage model with soft-prompt learning to jointly identify the relationship,novel findings, and entity roles. Our results in-clude an enriched BioREDcorpus with 10,864 directionality annotations. Moreover, our proposed methodoutperforms existing large language models such as the state-of-the-art GPT-4and Llama-3 on two benchmarking tasks.

Variousjailbreaking techniques have been developed to expose the vulnerabilities ofthese models and improve their safety. This work reveals that manystate-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs are vulnerable to maliciousrequests hidden behind scientific language. Specifically, our experiments withGPT4o, GPT4o-mini, GPT-4, LLama3-405B-Instruct, Llama3-70B-Instruct, Cohere,Gemini models on the StereoSet data demonstrate that, the models' biases andtoxicity substantially increase when prompted with requests that deliberatelymisinterpret social science and psychological studies as evidence supportingthe benefits of stereotypical biases. Alarmingly, these models can also bemanipulated to generate fabricated scientific arguments claiming that biasesare beneficial, which can be used by ill-intended actors to systematicallyjailbreak even the strongest models like GPT. Our analysis studies variousfactors that contribute to the models' vulnerabilities to malicious requests inacademic language.

This study evaluates the performance of several leading largelanguage models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini,and Mistral-AI's Large2, in understanding and analyzing concurrency issueswithin software programs. Given that relaxed memory models, such as Total StoreOrder (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO), are widely implemented and adaptedin modern systems, supported even by commodity architectures like ARM and x86,our evaluation focuses not only on sequentially consistent memory models butalso on these relaxed memory models. Specifically, we assess two main aspects:the models' capacity to detect concurrency problems under a sequentiallyconsistent memory model and their ability to verify the correctness conditionsof concurrent programs across both sequentially consistent and relaxed memorymodels. To do this, we leverage SV-COMP's pthread tests and 25 ARM Litmus testsdesigned to evaluate Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO)memory models. The experimental results reveal that GPT-4, GPT-4o, andMistral-AI's Large2 demonstrate a robust understanding of concurrency issues,effectively identifying data races and deadlocks when assessed under asequentially consistent memory model. However, despite its superiorperformance, all selected LLMs face significant challenges verifying programcorrectness under relaxed memory models. These LLMs exhibit limitations inaccurately capturing memory ordering constraints, and their currentcapabilities fall short in verifying even small programs in these complexscenarios.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nTitle: Test-Time Code-Switching for Cross-lingual Aspect Sentiment Triplet  Extraction\\nAuthors: Dongming Sheng, Kexin Han, Hao Li, Yan Zhang, Yucheng Huang, Jun Lang, Wenqiang Liu\\nPublished Date: 2025-01-24T00:00:51Z\\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14144v1\\nAbstract: Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is a thriving research area withimpressive outcomes being achieved on high-resource languages. However, theapplication of cross-lingual transfer to the ASTE task has been relativelyunexplored, and current code-switching methods still suffer from term boundarydetection issues and out-of-dictionary problems. In this study, we introduce anovel Test-Time Code-SWitching (TT-CSW) framework, which bridges the gapbetween the bilingual training phase and the monolingual test-time prediction.During training, a generative model is developed based on bilingualcode-switched training data and can produce bilingual ASTE triplets forbilingual inputs. In the testing stage, we employ an alignment-basedcode-switching technique for test-time augmentation. Extensive experiments oncross-lingual ASTE datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.We achieve an average improvement of 3.7% in terms of weighted-averaged F1 infour datasets with different languages. Additionally, we set a benchmark usingChatGPT and GPT-4, and demonstrate that even smaller generative modelsfine-tuned with our proposed TT-CSW framework surpass ChatGPT and GPT-4 by14.2% and 5.0% respectively.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nTitle: Enhancing Biomedical Relation Extraction with Directionality\\nAuthors: Po-Ting Lai, Chih-Hsuan Wei, Shubo Tian, Robert Leaman, Zhiyong Lu\\nPublished Date: 2025-01-23T20:36:11Z\\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14079v1\\nAbstract: Biological relation networks contain rich information for understanding thebiological mechanisms behind the relationship of entities such as genes,proteins, diseases, and chemicals. The vast growth of biomedical literatureposes significant challenges updating the network knowledge. The recentBiomedical Relation Extraction Dataset (BioRED) provides valuable manualannotations, facilitating the develop-ment of machine-learning and pre-trainedlanguage model approaches for automatically identifying novel document-level(inter-sentence context) relationships. Nonetheless, its annotations lackdirectionality (subject/object) for the entity roles, essential for studyingcomplex biological networks. Herein we annotate the entity roles of therelationships in the BioRED corpus and subsequently propose a novel multi-tasklanguage model with soft-prompt learning to jointly identify the relationship,novel findings, and entity roles. Our results in-clude an enriched BioREDcorpus with 10,864 directionality annotations. Moreover, our proposed methodoutperforms existing large language models such as the state-of-the-art GPT-4and Llama-3 on two benchmarking tasks.

Variousjailbreaking techniques have been developed to expose the vulnerabilities ofthese models and improve their safety. This work reveals that manystate-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs are vulnerable to maliciousrequests hidden behind scientific language. Specifically, our experiments withGPT4o, GPT4o-mini, GPT-4, LLama3-405B-Instruct, Llama3-70B-Instruct, Cohere,Gemini models on the StereoSet data demonstrate that, the models' biases andtoxicity substantially increase when prompted with requests that deliberatelymisinterpret social science and psychological studies as evidence supportingthe benefits of stereotypical biases. Alarmingly, these models can also bemanipulated to generate fabricated scientific arguments claiming that biasesare beneficial, which can be used by ill-intended actors to systematicallyjailbreak even the strongest models like GPT. Our analysis studies variousfactors that contribute to the models' vulnerabilities to malicious requests inacademic language.

I\\'m ready to assist you in moving from brainstorming to more concrete planning and development stages.**\\n\\nWhat would you like to focus on next?  Perhaps you have a favorite idea or a particular area you\\'re most interested in exploring further?', 'name': 'Product_manager', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"Okay, let's continue!  Since we have a substantial list of software product ideas, a logical next step is to **prioritize and select a few ideas that you find most promising and interesting to explore further.**\\n\\nTo help with this selection process, let's consider some criteria you might use to evaluate these ideas.  Think about what's important to you in a software product, whether it's for personal projects, entrepreneurial ventures, or simply intellectual exploration.\\n\\nHere are some criteria you might consider when evaluating the ideas:\\n\\n**Evaluation Criteria for Software Product Ideas:**\\n\\n*   **Personal Interest & Passion:**\\n    *   How excited are you about this idea?\\n    *   Are you genuinely interested in the problem it solves or the domain it operates in?\\n    *   Passion can be a significant driver for motivation and perseverance, especially in longer projects.\\n\\n*   **Market Potential & Demand:**\\n    *   Is there a real need or demand for this product?\\n    *   How large is the potential market?\\n    *   Are there existing competitors? If so, how would your product differentiate itself?\\n    *   Is there a clear path to monetization if that's a goal?\\n\\n*   **Technical Feasibility & Skills:**\\n    *   Is this idea technically feasible with current technology and your (or your team's) skills?\\n    *   What are the major technical challenges?\\n    *   Do you have access to the necessary resources and expertise?\\n    *   Is it a project that you can realistically tackle in a reasonable timeframe?\\n\\n*   **Novelty & Innovation:**\\n    *   How unique or innovative is this idea?\\n    *   Does it offer a significantly new approach or solution compared to existing products?\\n    *   Does it leverage GPT-4's capabilities in a novel way?\\n\\n*   **Potential Impact & Value:**\\n    *   How much positive impact could this product have on users or society?\\n    *   Does it solve a significant problem, improve efficiency, enhance user experience, or create new opportunities?\\n    *   What kind of value does it provide to potential users?\\n\\n*   **Learning & Growth Opportunity:**\\n    *   Would working on this project be a valuable learning experience for you?\\n    *   Would it allow you to develop new skills and expand your knowledge in relevant areas (AI, software development, specific industry domains)?\\n\\n*   **Time & Resources Required:**\\n    *   What is your estimated time commitment for developing an MVP or a more complete version?\\n    *   Do you have the necessary resources (time, money, tools, data) available?\\n    *   Is it a project that fits within your current constraints?\\n\\n**Your Task Now:**\\n\\n1.  **Review the Product Ideas:** Go back through the list of product ideas we've generated.\\n2.  **Consider the Criteria:** Think about each idea in relation to the evaluation criteria above.  You don't have to formally score them, but consider which ideas score higher or lower on each criterion *for you*.\\n3.  **Identify Top Candidates:** Based on your evaluation, select 2-3 ideas that you find most promising and interesting.  These could be the ones that score highly across multiple criteria or particularly excel in areas that are most important to you.\\n\\n**Once you've identified your top candidate ideas, we can then discuss them further.  For each chosen idea, we could:**\\n\\n*   **Deep Dive into Specific Features:**  Elaborate on the core features and functionalities in more detail.\\n*   **Brainstorm Potential User Personas:**  Define who the target users are and what their needs are.\\n*   **Outline a Basic Product Roadmap:**  Sketch out the steps to develop an MVP.\\n\\n**Take some time to review the ideas and think about these criteria.

The elbow should remain close to the body's side.  The arm should be raised smoothly and controlled to shoulder level and then abducted to 45 degrees. The movement should not surpass shoulder height. Band tension is modified by changing its length: a shorter length provides greater resistance, while a longer length lessens it.

      "{'question': 'How do you increase the flexibility of the hamstring by doing standing hamstring stretches?', 'short_answer': \"To increase hamstring flexibility during standing hamstring stretches, place your heel on a stool or chair with your leg straight and knee extended.  Anteriorly tilt your hips by rotating them forward to elongate the hamstrings. Lean your body forward, keeping your chest up, and hold for 20–30 seconds at 50–60% capacity. Then press your heel back onto the chair or bench for 6–8 seconds at 30–40% force. Relax for 30 seconds and repeat 5–6 times on each leg. Keep your shoulders square and face the leg you're stretching.\", 'multimodal_answer': 'To enhance hamstring flexibility during standing hamstring stretches, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Positioning:** Place your heel on a stable surface, like a chair or stool, ensuring your leg is straight and your knee is extended.  This elevates your leg, allowing for a greater range of motion. [Image frame showing the person with the leg on the stool](./image.jpg)\\n2. **Hip Rotation:** Rotate your hips forward to target the hamstring muscles effectively. This anterior pelvic tilt pre-stretches the hamstrings.\\n3. **Body Lean:** Lean your upper body forward while maintaining an upright chest. This increases the stretch on the hamstrings without compromising your back.\\n4. **Isometric Contraction:** Press your heel against the chair or bench for a few seconds (6-8 seconds) applying 30–40% of your maximum effort to further engage the hamstrings and promote flexibility. This isometric hold strengthens the muscles involved.\\n5. **Relaxation and Repetition:** After each set, relax for 30 seconds, allowing for muscle recovery and then repeat 5–6 times per leg. This cyclic process promotes consistent flexibility gains. \\n\\nThe image below shows the proper positioning and body alignment necessary for effectively performing a standing hamstring stretch to improve hamstring flexibility.', 'timestamp': 326, 'propose_a_question': 'In the video, the presenter explains how to perform standing hamstring stretches to increase flexibility.  Which of the following steps is NOT essential for correctly performing this stretch, and why?', 'grounded_answer_to_the_proposed_question': \"Based on the video (03:15-04:49), the step NOT essential for correctly performing the standing hamstring stretch is twisting your body to one side during the stretch.

The practitioner suggests using a medium resistance band, stating lighter ones may not provide enough stretch while stronger ones may be too difficult. [09:06-09:12].\\n* **Procedure:** The band is looped over a secure point above the individual's height [09:18-09:20].  The individual places their hand through the looped band, turns their palm to face away from the band, and straightens out their arm [09:21-09:26]. They gradually step away from the anchor point to increase the stretch around the front of their shoulder and possibly into their bicep [09:27-09:44]. The duration is 15-30 seconds [13:04-13:08]. The individual repeats the stretch for another 1-2 times [13:14-13:18].\\n\\n**2. Massage Ball Stretch:**\\nThis stretch utilizes a massage ball (such as a lacrosse ball, cross ball, or hockey ball) [10:50-11:00].\\n* **Procedure:** The individual places the ball underneath their arm and with their free hand pulls to get the ball further around their back [11:27-11:36]. Then lean against a wall to apply pressure to a tender point in the rotator cuff. The duration is 60 seconds per tender point, then the process is repeated on other points [12:01-12:32].\", 'answer_to_the_proposed_question': 'The video details two distinct shoulder stretches:\\n\\n**1. Resistance Band Stretch (09:18-09:44, 13:04-13:08):** Requires a medium resistance band.  The steps are to loop the band over a high point, place the hand through, turn the palm away, straighten the arm, and then step away from the anchor point for 15-30 seconds to stretch the anterior shoulder and bicep.

First, appropriate supplies must be gathered which include: PPE, appropriately sized sterile suction catheter, suction device, self-inflating bag, normal saline, pulse oximeter, and suction source.  A key step involves pre-measuring the suction catheter insertion depth (shown in the image below) to avoid damaging the airway. The image shows a hand holding the suction catheter, which is marked with measurement increments. This ensures that the catheter is inserted to the correct depth, minimizing the risk of complications. After inserting the catheter, suction is applied for less than 10 seconds before removing it with a twisting motion.

Which of the following techniques, as shown in the video, would best address the postural component of the problem, and why?', 'grounded_answer_to_the_proposed_question': 'The video demonstrates several techniques to address the posture component associated with neck pain from a pinched nerve. The most effective, initially, appears to be the ‘wall angel’ exercise demonstrated in the video between 06:26 and 06:57. The presenter explains the technique involves standing with your buttocks against a wall to promote proper spinal alignment. This is then followed by a chin tuck to ensure proper head positioning to release the nerve. (06:26-06:57).  The video further explores other approaches such as using a rolled towel for support during exercises and employing a foam roller. However, the wall angel method directly addresses the postural aspect that frequently contributes to pinched nerves by providing immediate feedback on proper alignment and reducing nerve compression [06:26-06:57, 07:46-08:04, 10:52-11:20]', 'answer_to_the_proposed_question': \"The 'wall angel' exercise is the most appropriate initial intervention due to its direct focus on postural correction. By using the wall as feedback, the patient can immediately correct their posture (shoulder blade retraction and chin tuck), thereby reducing the mechanical compression of the C6/C7 nerve roots.  Other techniques such as foam rolling and towel rolls address muscle tightness which may also contribute to the issue.\", 'video_url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7Gy9Q_Yhck', 'answer_start': '06:18', 'answer_end': '07:39'}\n",

This involves using a towel to apply gentle pressure and traction to the affected area of the neck. By isolating and mobilizing the specific vertebrae causing pain,  the exercises aim to restore normal range of motion and alleviate pain. The image below shows a key step in the extension mobilization technique, where the practitioner positions the towel around the neck to exert controlled pressure and encourage the upward movement of the head.

The otoscope is turned on at full intensity, and a new disposable ear tip is attached. The healthy ear is examined first for comparison, then the affected ear. The outer ear canal should be straightened for easier insertion of the speculum.  The otoscope is guided into the ear canal, adjusting the focus wheel as needed.

Also, specify the areas on the foot where tension should and shouldn't be applied, using the image at 02:25 as a reference.\", 'grounded_answer_to_the_proposed_question': \"The video demonstrates taping the big toe joint using KT tape to manage pain related to sesamoid injuries (sesamoiditis) and metatarsalgia. The procedure involves these steps:\\n1. **Measurement and Cutting:** A piece of KT tape is measured and cut to cover the affected area, extending from near the base of the metatarsals to just below the big toe joint. The tape is cut with one side slightly longer to aid in applying it to the foot's contour. [01:03-01:19]\\n2. **Anchor Points:** The tape is anchored at the base with no tension, ensuring the tape adheres well but without pulling the skin. [01:20-01:30] \\n3. **Application of Tension:** The key step is applying 50% tension to the central section of the tape, pulling the big toe gently downward into plantarflexion [01:52-02:07]. This is where the therapeutic effect of the tape lies in supporting the sesamoids and reducing strain on the associated ligaments and tendons.  This is crucial to avoid overstretching or discomfort. The image at 02:25 clearly shows the placement of tape and how tension is applied to the central section, with no tension at the anchor points. [01:52-02:07, 02:24-02:30]\\n4. **Final Adherence:** The final end is secured with no tension, allowing the tape to adhere properly without pulling. [02:07-02:08].  The entire taping process helps keep the toe in a plannar flexed position reducing pressure and inflammation in the sesamoid area.  [00:18-00:20, 02:24-02:30] \", 'answer_to_the_proposed_question': \"The KT tape application involves precise measurement and cutting to fit the foot's anatomy, anchoring the tape at the base and end points without tension to prevent skin irritation and maintain adherence. The crucial step is applying 50% tension across the central section of the tape, gently pulling the big toe into plantarflexion. This targeted tension in the middle section supports the sesamoids, alleviating strain on the surrounding ligaments and tendons.  The anchor points should have no tension. Improper application could lead to skin damage and decreased therapeutic efficacy.\", 'video_url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGHe0qCEwGM', 'answer_start': '00:00', 'answer_end': '02:37'}\n",

The second stretch is shown from 05:49 to 07:54, focusing on the external rotation of the hip.  This stretch aims to increase range of motion and alleviate pain by reducing bone-on-bone contact.', 'answer_to_the_proposed_question': 'A simple and effective stretch for hip pain relief is hip flexion, performed by placing one foot on a slightly elevated surface while using a pole for balance (from 10:09 to 11:26).  This stretch improves hip flexibility and reduces pain by stretching the often-tight hip flexors associated with osteoarthritis.  The second stretch involves external rotation and works in a different manner to improve range of motion.

Include a description of the mechanism of pain reduction.', 'grounded_answer_to_the_proposed_question': 'A pinched nerve in the neck, often affecting the brachial plexus, results in pain that radiates down the arm. The foam roller exercise targets the upper back muscles, which can be tight and contribute to poor posture. By lying supine with the foam roller positioned under the upper back and performing a gentle backward head extension combined with a chin tuck, this exercise works to release tightness in the upper back muscles (e.g., pectoralis minor and rhomboids). Reducing upper back tightness helps to decrease the impingement of the nerve roots, hence reducing nerve compression and the associated pain. [Video 02:00-02:50 demonstrates the anatomical location of the nerve; Video 07:40-09:05 demonstrates the foam roller exercise and pain reduction mechanism] ', 'answer_to_the_proposed_question': 'The foam roller exercise targets the upper trapezius, rhomboids, and pectoralis minor muscles, which when tight, contribute to poor posture and nerve compression in the neck (brachial plexus).  By lying supine and positioning the roller under the upper back, a gentle stretch is applied, counteracting the muscle tightness.  This stretch then reduces the anterior pull on the shoulder girdle, decreasing the impingement on the nerve roots exiting the cervical spine. The chin tuck enhances the stretch and promotes proper neck alignment. The combination of targeted myofascial release and postural realignment effectively alleviates pain and improves functional mobility.', 'video_url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7Gy9Q_Yhck', 'answer_start': '07:40', 'answer_end': '09:05'}\n",

At [03:15], it shows a mechanical model using a pulley and rope and shows how the rope (tendon) gets hung up. At [07:21], they explain how to use the rubber bands to strengthen the extensor tendons.', 'answer_to_the_proposed_question': \"The rubber band exercise for trigger finger leverages the principles of resistance training to strengthen the extensor muscles.  In trigger finger, the flexor tendons are typically tight, causing the finger to lock or catch. The rubber band provides resistance to the finger's extension, forcing the extensor muscles to work harder during each repetition.  This targeted resistance training builds strength in the extensors, restoring the balance between flexor and extensor forces and reducing the likelihood of the finger locking. The improved extensor strength allows for a smoother range of motion and prevents the tendon from catching on the A1 pulley.\", 'video_url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXGFI5s0bOY', 'answer_start': '07:16', 'answer_end': '07:41'}\n",
